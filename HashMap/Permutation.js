// You are given two strings, A and B, of size N and M, respectively.

// You have to find the count of all permutations of A present in B as a substring. You can assume a string will have only lowercase letters.

// The aim is to find the count of all permutations of string X present in Y as a substring.
// Can Hashing help us to find all the permutations?

// A = "abc"
//  B = "abcbacabc"
//  o/p:5
